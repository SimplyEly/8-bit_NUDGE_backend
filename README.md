Our team at the School of Code bootcamp came together to address real-world issues that impact our society. Through brainstorming and discussion, we identified students' lack of motivation to study. In response, we developed an app to empower individuals and prompt them to revise consistently and implementing that social aspect of competing with friends, in attempt of making revision more fun!
